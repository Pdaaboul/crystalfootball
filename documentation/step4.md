# Step 4: Packages CMS Implementation

**Completed:** Crystal Football Packages Content Management System with database schema, admin CRUD interface, and public rendering.

## Overview

This step implements a complete packages management system that allows admins to create, edit, and manage subscription packages with features, while providing a responsive public-facing packages page driven by live database content.

## Database Schema

### New Migration: `supabase/migrations/0005_packages.sql`

#### Tables Created

**`public.packages`**
```sql
- id: uuid (primary key, auto-generated)
- slug: text (unique, for URL routing)
- name: text (package display name)
- tier: text (enum: 'monthly', 'half_season', 'full_season')
- description: text (marketing description)
- duration_days: int (subscription length in days)
- price_cents: int (current price in cents)
- original_price_cents: int nullable (for showing discounts)
- is_active: boolean (controls public visibility)
- sort_index: int (display ordering)
- created_by: uuid (references profiles.user_id)
- updated_by: uuid (references profiles.user_id)
- created_at: timestamptz (auto-set)
- updated_at: timestamptz (auto-updated via trigger)
```

**`public.package_features`**
```sql
- id: uuid (primary key, auto-generated)
- package_id: uuid (references packages.id, cascade delete)
- label: text (feature description)
- sort_index: int (display ordering within package)
```

#### Constraints and Triggers

- **Unique constraint:** `(package_id, label)` prevents duplicate features per package
- **Check constraints:** Valid tier values, positive price/duration, original price higher than current
- **Updated_at trigger:** Automatically updates `updated_at` timestamp on package changes
- **Cascade delete:** Removing a package automatically removes its features

#### Row Level Security (RLS)

**Packages policies:**
- Public/authenticated: Read only active packages (`is_active = true`)
- Admin/superadmin: Full read access to all packages
- Admin/superadmin: Insert, update, delete permissions
- `created_by`/`updated_by` set automatically server-side

**Package features policies:**
- Public/authenticated: Read features of active packages only
- Admin/superadmin: Full CRUD access
- Cascading visibility based on parent package status

#### Seed Data

Three pre-configured packages matching Crystal Football's offering:
- **Monthly Plan:** $50, 30 days, 5 features
- **Half-Season Plan:** $225 ($250 original), 150 days, 8 features (marked "Popular")
- **Full Season Plan:** $400 ($500 original), 300 days, 12 features (marked "Best Value")

## Backend Implementation

### TypeScript Types (`src/lib/types/packages.ts`)

```typescript
export type PackageTier = 'monthly' | 'half_season' | 'full_season';
export interface Package { ... }
export interface PackageFeature { ... }
export interface PackageWithFeatures extends Package { features: PackageFeature[]; }
export interface CreatePackageData { ... }
export interface UpdatePackageData { ... }
```

### Utility Functions (`src/lib/utils/packages.ts`)

**Price management:**
- `dollarsToCents(dollars)` / `centsToDollars(cents)`: Conversion utilities
- `formatPrice(cents)`: Currency formatting with proper localization
- `calculateDiscountPercentage()`: Automatic discount calculation
- `validatePrice(input)`: Input validation with error messages

**Slug management:**
- `generateSlug(text)`: URL-safe slug generation
- `autoGenerateSlug(name, existing)`: Ensures uniqueness
- `isValidSlug(slug)`: Format validation

**Display helpers:**
- `getTierDisplayName()` / `getTierBadgeClasses()`: UI consistency
- `getDurationText(days)`: Human-readable duration formatting

### API Routes

## Hardening and Security Enhancements

### Additional Migration: `supabase/migrations/0005b_packages_policies.sql`

**Enhanced RLS Policies:**
- **Explicit anon access:** Anonymous users can read only active packages and their features
- **Authenticated user access:** Same as anonymous (read-only active packages)
- **Admin/superadmin access:** Full CRUD permissions on all packages and features
- **Separate policies:** Distinct policies for anon, authenticated, and admin users for clarity

**Audit Trigger:**
- `stamp_package_audit()` function automatically sets `created_by` and `updated_by` from `auth.uid()`
- Applied on INSERT (sets both) and UPDATE (sets updated_by only)
- Eliminates manual audit field management in application code

**Performance Indexes:**
- `idx_packages_active_sort`: Optimizes public queries for active packages ordered by sort_index
- `idx_packages_slug`: Fast slug lookups for admin operations
- `idx_package_features_package_sort`: Efficient feature queries with proper ordering
- `idx_packages_sort_all`: Admin queries for all packages by sort order

### Environment Standardization

**Consistent Variable Names:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000` for development
- `ADMIN_WHATSAPP_E164_LIST` standardized across all components
- Align Supabase Dashboard SITE_URL with development URL

### Performance Optimizations

**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):**
- Public packages page: `export const revalidate = 60`
- Static generation with 60-second cache invalidation
- Anonymous Supabase client for RLS-compliant data access
- Empty state handling with proper fallbacks

**Price Display Enhancements:**
- Safe `Intl.NumberFormat` for consistent currency formatting
- Strikethrough only when `original_price_cents > price_cents`
- Computed discount badges with percentage calculation
- Null-safe price handling throughout

### Admin UI Enhancements

**Advanced Validation:**
- Async slug uniqueness checking before form submission
- Server-side validation for tier, duration, and price constraints
- Inline error display with field-specific messaging
- Unsaved changes warning with beforeunload protection

**Enhanced Features:**
- Filter toggle: View "All Packages" or "Active Only"
- Package counts in filter dropdown
- Submit button disabled during save operations
- Cache revalidation after successful saves

**Improved UX:**
- Real-time slug generation from package name
- Price conversion from dollars to cents on submit
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Responsive form layouts across all breakpoints

### Security Hardening

**API Security:**
- All write operations require admin/superadmin role verification
- Service role key never exposed to client-side code
- RLS policies enforced at database level
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints

**Access Control Testing:**
- Anonymous users: Read-only access to active packages/features
- Regular users: Cannot perform write operations (blocked by RLS)
- Admin/superadmin: Full CRUD access with audit trail
- Non-admin users: Cannot access admin routes (middleware protection)

**Additional API Routes:**
- `/api/admin/packages/check-slug`: Slug uniqueness validation
- `/api/revalidate`: Manual cache invalidation for admins

### Testing & Validation

**Security Tests:**
- âœ… Anonymous users can only read active packages and features
- âœ… Regular authenticated users cannot write to packages tables
- âœ… Admin role verification on all administrative endpoints
- âœ… Service role key not exposed in client bundle
- âœ… RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access

**Performance Tests:**
- âœ… Public packages page loads with ISR optimization
- âœ… Database queries use appropriate indexes
- âœ… Price calculations are accurate and safe
- âœ… Build optimization and bundle analysis

**Responsive Design Tests:**
- âœ… 320px minimum width with no horizontal scroll
- âœ… Touch targets â‰¥44px on mobile devices
- âœ… Focus-visible rings on all interactive elements
- âœ… WCAG AA color contrast on cyan/black/white palette
- âœ… Proper scaling across 375/768/1024/1280px breakpoints

### Deployment Checklist

**Database Migration:**
1. Apply `0005b_packages_policies.sql` migration
2. Verify RLS policies with test users of different roles
3. Confirm audit trigger sets created_by/updated_by correctly
4. Test performance with indexes on large datasets

**Environment Configuration:**
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000` for development
2. Align Supabase Dashboard SITE_URL with application URL
3. Configure `ADMIN_WHATSAPP_E164_LIST` for notification testing
4. Verify all environment variables are properly referenced

**Application Testing:**
1. Test ISR behavior with 60-second revalidation
2. Verify admin can create/edit/delete packages with validation
3. Confirm anonymous users see only active packages
4. Test responsive design across all target breakpoints
